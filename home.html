	<br><br>
	I go by JB.	
	<br>
	<!-- about me -->
	I am a web developer based in the Philippines who has a passion for making beautiful and functional user experiences.
	<br>
	I used to work for Google and provide support for their hardware until I found my passion which is web development. Thanks to Tuitt, I am fortunate to be in an environment which allows me to pair program, work in groups, learn new techniques of solving problems, and learn different ways of thinking from experienced developers, accelerating my learning and ability to adapt in a professional environment.
<br><br>
	In my free time I train MMA or I play video games on the PC.
